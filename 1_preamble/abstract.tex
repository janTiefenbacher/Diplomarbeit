\section{Abstract}
As part of this diploma thesis, the mobile application WoSamma was developed – 
a geo-information-based quiz game that allows users to recognize and locate virtual places 
within Austria. 
The app combines playful learning with modern mapping technology and offers 
various game modes, including single-player, friends, and multiplayer modes. 
In addition, a friends and chat system was integrated to enhance the social aspect of the game.
